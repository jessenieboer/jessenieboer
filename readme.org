hello, world!

** About me
I used to be a programmer for [[https://www.vermeer.com/na][Vermeer Corporation]], a global manufacturing company, but a [[https://ryr1.org/][genetic muscle disease]] interrupted my career in 2017. Having spent years resting, adjusting to my limitations, and experimenting with different techniques and technologies, I'm tentatively, but enthusiastically, reemerging into public.

- Customizing Emacs to further enable efficient computer use
- Building a primary development environment with NixOS
  
** Past endeavors
- Designed the [[https://github.com/jessenieboer/relax-keyboard-layout][Relax Keyboard Layout]] to minimize muscle movement while typing

** Future Endeavors?
- Develop my own system of work management in Emacs
- Learn Lisp
- Learn Haskell
- Learn language development with Racket
- Study ontology and knowledge organization

** Other interests
